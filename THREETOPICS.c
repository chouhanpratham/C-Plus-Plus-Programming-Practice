//Problem :The Chef has reached the finals of the Annual Inter-school Declamation contest.For the finals, students were asked to prepare 1010 topics. However, Chef was only able to prepare three topics, numbered AA, BB and CC â€” he is totally blank about the other topics. This means Chef can only win the contest if he gets the topics AA, BB or CC to speak about.
//On the contest day, Chef gets topic XX. Determine whether Chef has any chances of winning the competition.
